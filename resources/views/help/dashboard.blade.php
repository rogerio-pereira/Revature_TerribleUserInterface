            There's nothing that you could break on this screen, so you don't need help to this page. But I like to be proactive,
            so here are some tips for your life:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth.</li>
            <li>You are not as fat as you imagine.</li>
            <li>Don't worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum.</li>
            <li>Do one thing every day that scares you.</li>
            <li>Sing.</li>
            <li>Don't be reckless with other people's hearts.</li>
            <li>Don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.</li>
            <li>Floss.</li>
            <li>Don't waste your time on jealousy.</li>
            <li>Remember compliments you receive.</li>
            <li>Forget the insults.</li>
            <li>If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.</li>
            <li>Keep your old love letters.</li>
            <li>Throw away your old bank statements.</li>
            <li>Stretch.</li>
            <li>Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life.</li>
            <li>Get plenty of calcium.</li>
            <li>Be kind to your knees.</li>
            <li>Don't congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either</li>
            <li>Your choices are half chance.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your body.</li>
            <li>Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.</li>
            <li>Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.</li>
            <li>Do not read beauty magazines.</li>
            <li>Get to know your parents.</li>
            <li>Be nice to your siblings.</li>
            <li>Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on.</li>
            <li>Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle.</li>
            <li>Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.</li>
            <li>Travel.</li>
            <li>Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you'll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.</li>
            <li>Respect your elders.</li>
            <li>Don't expect anyone else to support you.</li>
            <li>Don't mess too much with your hair or by the time you're 40 it will look 85.</li>
            <li>Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it.</li>
            <li>Wear sunscreen.</li>
        </ol>
